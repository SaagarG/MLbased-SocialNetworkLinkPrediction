# MLbased-SocialNetworkLinkPrediction
Link prediction methods anticipate the likelihood of a future connection between two nodes in a given network. The methods are essential in social networks to infer social interactions or to suggest possible friends to the users. Rapid social network growth trigger link prediction analysis to be more challenging especially with the significant advancement in complex social network modeling.

## Problem statement:
Given a directed social graph, have to predict missing links to recommend users (Link Prediction in graph)

## Business objectives and constraints:

No low-latency requirement.

Probability of prediction is useful to recommend ighest probability links

Performance metric for supervised learning:

Both precision and recall is important so F1 score is good choice

Confusion matrix
